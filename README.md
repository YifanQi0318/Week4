Added Features

o (LEVEL 2)Gambler Game//not finished

Each player will start with $100, and each player needs to choose the amount to bet each time the game starts,  the winner gets all the money back.


o (LEVEL 1) At end of round, players are collectively asked if they want to keep playing. Players only enter Y 
or N once, so discussion of continuing happens outside the game. If players choose to keep going, a new 
deck is built and shuffled. In addition, player list is shuffled, to ensure the same person doesn’t always 
win a tiebreaker. 


o (LEVEL 2) At end of round, each player is asked if they want to keep playing. If a player says no, 
they are removed from the player list. If only 1 player remains, that player is the winner 
(equivalent to everyone else “folding” in a card game). 

o (Extra)Change the player's card draw form, choose from 0-3 cards.

o (Extra 2)Changed some Text


About public: I didn't add private because I think it is enough to hold this data， If the value entered in the game is negative, the console will prompt the player and return instead of producing an undesired effect.



For this project, I think the player's status bar needs to be edited so that the current number of cards, 
score/chips, and status are displayed next to their name. The other is to set a counter in each link to 
display the number of rounds. If necessary, I hope to add functions such as players choosing their own color/avatar.
