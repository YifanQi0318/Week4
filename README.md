Added Features

o (LEVEL 1) At end of round, players are collectively asked if they want to keep playing. Players only enter Y 
or N once, so discussion of continuing happens outside the game. If players choose to keep going, a new 
deck is built and shuffled. In addition, player list is shuffled, to ensure the same person doesn’t always 
win a tiebreaker. 
o (LEVEL 2) At end of round, each player is asked if they want to keep playing. If a player says no, 
they are removed from the player list. If only 1 player remains, that player is the winner 
(equivalent to everyone else “folding” in a card game). 
o (Extra)Change the player's card draw form, choose from 0-3 cards.
o (Extra 2)
